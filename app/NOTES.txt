- frame: 'none' is the important line that gets rid of buttons





- I can open a new chrome app window but don't know if it's possible for a webapp to postMessage to its parent 
- Iframes should be able to postMessage their parent but...
- iframes don't appear to work b/c Chrome won't let you relax the CSP for apps (but you can do it for extensions)
- So maybe I should make this an extension instead of an app...? Especially as apps are going away?
